World’s 2nd Largest Khewra Salt Mines in Pakistan</h2>

Khewra Salt Mines were said to be discovered by Alexander the Great in 326 BC. Well, that’s not exactly correct. The true credit for discovering<br /> the salt in Khewra goes to his horse. This is because when his army stopped to rest in Khewra, Alexander’s horse and the horses <br />of his soldiers began licking the stones on the ground. A brave soldier tried it himself and discovered the salty flavor.<p\>
<P>
Today, the Khewra salt mines are the second largest in the world. They turn out 325,000 tons of salt a year. The output over its lifetime is estimated<br /> to be 220 million tons. Amazingly, this isn’t even a dent into the salt that’s stored here, which is estimated to be about<br /> 6.687 billion tons. The mine is 748 feet deep with 11 stories, the mine is filled with tunnels that run nearly half a mile<br /> into the mountain. Only 50% of what is mined is taken out, the other 50% is used as support columns in the<br /> enormous mine.
